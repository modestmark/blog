			<p>SQL, Structured Query Language, is both a piece of server software which hosts
			and keeps organized a database system and a, well, <i>structured language</i>
			for interacting with it and <i>querying</i> the database.</p>
			
			<p>That's a mouthful.  An SQL database is essentially a collection of spreadsheets, 
			which it calls <vocab>tables</vocab>.  Tables have, just like spreadsheets,
			<vocab>columns</vocab> and <vocab>rows</vocab>.  
			Tables are generally used to represent a list of objects.</p>
			
			<p>Let's look at a table.  This table's named <i>Partiers</i>.</p>
			
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>FirstName</th>
					<th>LastName</th>
					<th>PhoneNumber</th>
					<th>Cool?</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Tristán</td>
					<td>Peura</td>
					<td>555-6477</td>
					<td>TRUE</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Nathan</td>
					<td>Van Houten</td>
					<td>555-8580</td>
					<td>FALSE</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Vartolomej</td>
					<td>Dirkx</td>
					<td>555-4881</td>
					<td>TRUE</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Károly</td>
					<td>Janssens</td>
					<td>555-5338</td>
					<td>TRUE</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Kasper</td>
					<td>Kovačević</td>
					<td>555-1720</td>
					<td>FALSE</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>As you can see, each row represents <i>one</i> of the objects in 
			the list (in this case, a partier), and 
			each column represents a <i>property</i> of those objects that, at least in theory,
			most objects will have a value for (otherwise, that row will have an empty, or
			"NULL" value, in that column).  Each "cell" in spreadsheet
			terms, or individual piece of data (like Kasper's first name, or phone number)
			is called a <vocab>field</vocab>.<p>
			
			<p>Now, <vocab>SQL</vocab>, like I said earlier, partly defines <b>a language 
			to interact with these tables</b>.  Let's check out a few commands in this 
			language, with the caveat that there are multiple major flavors of <vocab>SQL</vocab> 
			out there and that these commands might require slight tweaks for some flavors.  
			This is just to give yall a taste of what interacting with <vocab>SQL</vocab> is 
			like, moreso than an actual instructional primer on how to <vocab>SQL</vocab>.
			BEHOLD</p>

			<p>Need to get some information from the table?  Let's use a <b>SELECT</b> 
			statement.  I want to invite some people to a party.  Let's get a guest list 
			going, here.</p>

			<code>SELECT FirstName, PhoneNumber<br>
				FROM Partiers<br>
				WHERE Cool? = TRUE</code><br><br>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>FirstName</th>
					<th>PhoneNumber</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Tristán</td>
					<td>555-6477</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Vartolomej</td>
					<td>555-4881</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Károly</td>
					<td>555-5338</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>(Don't worry about the spacing and line breaks in these queries.  
			<vocab>SQL</vocab>, 
			like most programming languages, doesn't really care what you do with either, so 
			just try to make it look organized in a way that makes sense to you.)  Anyway, 
			here's what we get:</p>

			<p>Let's break that down.  SELECT is the command to retrieve data from a 
			<vocab>table</vocab>, followed by the names of the <vocab>columns</vocab> 
			you actually want the data from.  FROM is necessary; you've got to specify 
			the name of which <vocab>table</vocab> in the <vocab>database</vocab> you want 
			the data from.  The final bit we added there, the WHERE condition, isn't 
			<b>necessary</b> for SELECT queries, but without it SELECT will just grab 
			<b>every</b> <vocab>row</vocab>, so we use this to specify 
			only to grab partiers whose "Cool?" 
			value is TRUE.  I don't need those uncool kids making messes all over my 
			parents' house while they're out of town.  I ain't cleanin' up after that.</p>

			<p>Alright!  Let's do something else.  One of our closest homies is vouching 
			for another partier.  Let's throw em in the table.  This partier's name is 
			Pris Taylor, her number is 555-8905, and from what we <i>hear</i> she's cool.  
			Let's put her in with another statement, an INSERT:</p>

			<code>INSERT INTO Partiers<br>(FirstName, LastName, PhoneNumber, Cool?)<br>VALUES<br>( 
			'Pris', 'Taylor', '555-8905', TRUE)</code>

			<p>Pretty straightforward, right?  INSERT INTO &gt;tablename&lt;, the names of the 
			<vocab>columns</vocab>, then specify the VALUES in the same order that you specified 
			the <vocab>columns</vocab>.  Right, well, theoretically she's in our growing 
			rolodex now.  Let's check:</p>

			<code>SELECT * FROM Partiers</code><br><br>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>FirstName</th>
					<th>LastName</th>
					<th>PhoneNumber</th>
					<th>Cool?</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Tristán</td>
					<td>Peura</td>
					<td>555-6477</td>
					<td>TRUE</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Nathan</td>
					<td>Van Houten</td>
					<td>555-8580</td>
					<td>FALSE</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Vartolomej</td>
					<td>Dirkx</td>
					<td>555-4881</td>
					<td>TRUE</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Károly</td>
					<td>Janssens</td>
					<td>555-5338</td>
					<td>TRUE</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Kasper</td>
					<td>Kovačević</td>
					<td>555-1720</td>
					<td>FALSE</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Pris</td>
					<td>Taylor</td>
					<td>555-8905</td>
					<td>TRUE</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>Yep.</p>

			<p>There are naturally more ways to interact with <vocab>tables</vocab> in 
			<vocab>SQL</vocab>, but beyond adding (INSERT) and retrieving (SELECT) data, 
			I'm only going to show you one more - the all-important JOIN.  Excel nerds, 
			these are your vlookups (basically).  Non-Excel nerds, this is what you use to 
			cross-reference tables.  You'll see what I mean in a second.</p>

			<p>Let's say we have another <vocab>table</vocab>, "PartyHouses".  This is what that 
			<vocab>table</vocab> looks like:

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>FirstName</th>
					<th>LastName</th>
					<th>Address</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Tristán</td>
					<td>Peura</td>
					<td>15 Rich Kid Ln</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Nathan</td>
					<td>Van Houten</td>
					<td>73 Irradiated Dr</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Vartolomej</td>
					<td>Dirkx</td>
					<td>2365 Backwoods St</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Károly</td>
					<td>Janssens</td>
					<td>800 Mugging Blvd</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Kasper</td>
					<td>Kovačević</td>
					<td>92 Gilded Ln</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Pris</td>
					<td>Taylor</td>
					<td>1 Bourgeois Ct</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>We're trying to find a spot for our next rager, but we want to be sure that it's 
			at a cool person's house.  We don't want them making a big deal out of the mess we 
			totally leave there.  Buckle up, this is about to get crazy:</p>

			<code>SELECT Partiers.FirstName, Partiers.LastName,<br>
				Partiers.PhoneNumber, Partiers.Cool?,<br>
			PartyHouses.Address<br>
			FROM Partiers<br>
			JOIN PartyHouses ON Partiers.FirstName=PartyHouses.FirstName</code><br><br>

			<p>Whoa!  Let's break that down real quicklike.  Firstly, you'll notice that since 
			we're joining multiple <vocab>tables</vocab>, when specifying the columns we want to 
			SELECT we need to specify which <vocab>table</vocab> each <vocab>column</vocab> is 
			in using the format &lt;tablename&gt;.&lt;columnname&gt;.  
			Not a huge deal.  Which <vocab>table</vocab> you use as your FROM only matters 
			when you're using specific types of JOINs I'll talk about in a second.  Finally, we 
			do the JOIN itself, which says that FirstName in the Partiers table is equal to 
			FirstName in the PartyHouses table.  In other words, we want to line up the data 
			<vocab>fields</vocab> of the rows where the first name matches between the two 
			<vocab>tables</vocab>.  Phew.  Here's what comes out:</p>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>FirstName</th>
					<th>LastName</th>
					<th>PhoneNumber</th>
					<th>Cool?</th>
					<th>Address</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Tristán</td>
					<td>Peura</td>
					<td>555-6477</td>
					<td>TRUE</td>
					<td>15 Rich Kid Ln</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Nathan</td>
					<td>Van Houten</td>
					<td>555-8580</td>
					<td>FALSE</td>
					<td>73 Irradiated Dr</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Vartolomej</td>
					<td>Dirkx</td>
					<td>555-4881</td>
					<td>TRUE</td>
					<td>2365 Backwoods St</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Károly</td>
					<td>Janssens</td>
					<td>555-5338</td>
					<td>TRUE</td>
					<td>800 Mugging Blvd</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Kasper</td>
					<td>Kovačević</td>
					<td>555-1720</td>
					<td>FALSE</td>
					<td>92 Gilded Ln</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Pris</td>
					<td>Taylor</td>
					<td>555-8905</td>
					<td>TRUE</td>
					<td>1 Bourgeois Ct</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>Boom.  Now we have everything we need to figure out who to ring up.</p>


			
			<p>You might ask: "Why SQL?"  Why didn't we settle on keeping all data that programs store
			in <i>normal</i> spreadsheets, or text files, or what have you?  Why do we need all
			of this convoluted standard query syntax?</p>
			
			<p><b>SQL is designed to be as efficient as is <i>computationally possible</i>.<br>
			Interacting through queries with a well-designed database - 
			one with few, descriptive tables only occasionally
			needing to perform joins - is somewhere in the ballpark of 
			an <i>order of magnitude</i> (ten <i>times</i>)
			faster performing than its non-SQL database serving cousins.  So yeah.  Use SQL.</b><p>
