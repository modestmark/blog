			<booming><i>HOWDY</i></booming>
			<p>Learning about technology is confusing for, in my estimation, two big overarching reasons: 
				tech people <i>love</i> using convoluted jargon to impress one another, and every minute 
				region of the technology map seems to want to reinvent the rules and jargon for itself 
				and secede from greater tech as a whole.  I want to help address both issues; the posts 
				that you, dear reader, will find on this site aim to explain big technologies using 
				as little jargon as possible (while easing you into the core terms needed to be conversant 
				in said technology) and to contextualize these technologies within the big picture  
				of technology as a whole.  This stuff is really not as complicated as one would think, 
				from the way we nerds can talk about it sometimes!</p>

			<p>Now, keep in mind that these articles are only primers, and I use a lot of
				analogy; while I strive to avoid any analogies that can misconstrue a point and/or
				outright factual inaccuracies, you'll want to remember that this is <b>only a 
				starting point</b>.  If you just need a quick "how stuff works" type primer, they 
				should be fine, but they won't make you an expert.  
				These are comprehensive bird's eye views of individual 
				topics, intended to be fleshed out with actual experience and study; an 
				architectural plan for the house of your knowledge.  So read 
				along as I ramble to my fake grandkids about what I think is important to know about 
				technology, while they'd likely prefer to be doing literally anything else.</p>

			<p>I'm the old man reffi and I like to think I know enough to 
				preach about this stuff, sometimes from work experience, sometimes from 
				playing around with things for personal projects, and sometimes just from research - 
				not all of the topics I'll be talking about are areas of extensive experience for 
				me, but I might need to speak on them regardless to make another point, or just find 
				them to be poorly understood topics (I'm a knowledge vigilante, wahoo!)
				If anyone has an issue with one of my posts,
				let me know and if you're right I'll fix it!  I'm not too proud to admit 
				when I'm wrong.</p>
